                                As the price of installing solar has gotten less expensive, more homeowners are turning to it as a possible option for decreasing their energy bill. We want to make installing solar panels easy and understandable for anyone.

                            <p>
                                Project Sunroof puts Google's expansive data in mapping and computing resources to use, helping calculate the best solar plan for you.

                                When you enter your address, Project Sunroof looks up your home in Google Maps and combines that information with other databases to create your personalized roof analysis.

                                Project Sunroof recommends an installation size to generate close to 100% of your electricity use, based on roof size, the amount of sun hitting the roof, and your electricity bill.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Solar panel installations come in sizes measured in kilowatts (kW). When discussing solar installation with your providers, the recommended installation size (in kW) is a good starting point for a more fine-tuned estimate of total costs and benefits.
                            </p>
                            <figure>

                            <p>
                                We recommend an installation that covers less than 100% of your electrical usage because, in most areas, there is little financial benefit to producing more power than you can consume.

                                Hint: Change the amount of your average electrical bill with the bill slider to get a more accurate, customized estimate for your house.
